# Contributing to MiQ Hand

Thanks for considering a contribution — this seed is meant to grow wild.

Ways to help:
- Improve ring detection (better Hough params, add adaptive thresholding for shadows)
- Add new haptic patterns (DRV2605 effects for different scores/modes)
- Port to farm bots (row detection, crop health zones from colors)
- Enhance relic disc format (add compression, checksums, QR backup)
- Test on weird boards (non-standard sizes, low light, projector setups)
- Write docs (wiring diagrams, 3D mount STLs, tuning guide)
- Add accessibility (eye tracking, voice-free modes)

No rules — fork, experiment, break it, fix it, PR if you want.

Just keep it open, keep it free, keep it for the hero.

❤️👾
